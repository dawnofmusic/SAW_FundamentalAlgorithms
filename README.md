Fundamental Algorithms
======================
About this project
------------------
This project just contains some sources I created during the last couple of 
years when I tried to understand some basic algorithms in computer sciences. 
Maybe you'll find it useful. In that case you're welcome to use it.

It includes
   * backtracking algorithms
   * towers of hanoi
   * pythagoras tree
   * and more

This project has been developed using the Eclipse IDE (http://www.eclipse.org).

Programming Language: Java (JavaSE-1.6)
