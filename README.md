About this project
------------------
This project just contains some sources I created during the last couple of 
years when I tried to understand some basic algorithms in computational sciences. 
Maybe you'll find it useful. In that case you're welcome to use it.

This project has been developed using the Eclipse IDE (http://www.eclipse.org).
